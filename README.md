## Project Overview
Stanford University is a private research university in California. Founded in 1885, it boasts 83 Nobel laureates, 28 Turing Award laureates, and 8 Fields Medalists. The library, also established in 1885, now holds over 4 million books serving 20,000+ students. To manage this vast collection efficiently, Stanford implemented Library Management Software for quick book searches, issues, reissues, and accurate data management, saving time and effort.

## Business Analysis Core Concept Model (BACCM)

### Need
- High time consumption in managing the manual library
- Large number of employees needed
- Tedious and time-consuming fine calculation
- Lack of report generation on issued books
- Difficult to manage 4 million books
- Limited book deposit timings for students

### Change
- Implement a Library Management Software to automate the libraryâ€™s activities.

### Solution
- Online library management system to track and maintain all library transactions.

### Context
- The LMS maintains records of all books and their details, including issued, available, and fined books. Book deposits can be done anytime using the RFID reader at the book drop station.

### Value/Business Objectives
- Reduce overheads and increase library staff productivity
- Cost reduction
- Up-to-date records of all library materials
- Improve student engagement
- Generate dynamic reports for better decision-making

### Stakeholders
- Students, Alumni, Faculty, Library Staff, University Management, IT Staff

## Requirement Classification Schema

### Business Requirements
- Automate library activities for efficiency.
- Enable quick book searches, issues, and reissues.
- Provide accurate and immediate information on all library materials.

### Stakeholder Requirements
- Record and categorize all reading materials.
- Generate various management reports.
- Track fines and book losses.

### Solution Requirements
- RFID tagging for all materials
- Automated email notifications
- Online and mobile access for students

### Transition Requirements
- Transition from manual to online management
- Training for library staff and stakeholders

## Problem Statement
- High time consumption in managing manual library
- Large number of employees needed
- Tedious fine calculation
