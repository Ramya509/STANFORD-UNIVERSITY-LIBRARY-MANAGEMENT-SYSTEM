# STANFORD-UNIVERSITY-LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Stanford University, founded in 1885, has 83 Nobel laureates, 28 Turing Award laureates, and 8 Fields Medalists. Its library, now holding over 4 million books for 20,000+ students, needed efficient management. Library Management Software was implemented for quick book searches, issues, reissues, and accurate data handling.
